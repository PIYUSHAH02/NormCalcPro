# NormCalc Pro: IE 2 Norm Calculator

## Overview
NormCalc Pro is a web-based application for calculating normative mineralogy using the CIPW norm method. This tool allows users to input the chemical composition of an igneous rock and receive a calculated normative mineral content based on various Fe adjustment methods.

## Features
- Input fields for major oxide compositions (SiO₂, Al₂O₃, Fe₂O₃, FeO, MgO, CaO, Na₂O, K₂O).
- Fe adjustment options:
  - **None**: No adjustment to Fe values.
  - **Constant**: Allows for input of a fixed FeO/Fe₂O₃ ratio.
  - **Le Maitre**: Adjusts Fe values based on igneous rock type (Plutonic or Volcanic).
  - **Middlemost**: Adjusts Fe values based on empirical data.
  - **Specified**: Allows users to specify a mineral type, impacting the Fe calculations.
- Displays normative mineral results based on the input composition and selected adjustment method.
